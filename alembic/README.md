## Overview
[Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) is the migration tool used to make and manage changes to the 
database.

For connection, ensure the `.env` file is properly filled so that Alembic can connect. Follow the Alembic 
documentation for how to make new revisions.

Ensure a message about what the change is doing is added to any revision.
